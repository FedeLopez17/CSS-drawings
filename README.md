# CSS Drawings :art: :paintbrush:

### [See index of drawings](https://fedelopez17.github.io/CSS-drawings/)

## Description:
Inspired by Lynn Fisher's [A Single Div](https://a.singlediv.com/) project, I decided to start a similar endeavor myself as a fun way of honing my CSS skills.<br>

## Observations:
 - Although I plan to develop a proper way of showcasing the drawings in the future, they can only be accessed through a provisional utilitarian page for the time being.<br>
 - Unlike Lynn Fisher, I haven't set any constraints for my drawings. Nevertheless, I will definitely experiment with different constraints, be it using only a single HTML element or any other variations I come up with.

## Things I want to draw:
- Flags
- Football clubs' badges
- Animals
- Fictional characters
- Food
