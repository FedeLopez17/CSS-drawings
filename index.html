        <summary>Reflections:</summary>
        <p>
          My first CSS drawing was the flag of my beloved Uruguay, with the only
          self-imposed restraint being that I was to craft the entire drawing
          using only one HTML element.<br />
          Originally, I had hoped to be able to accurately replicate the flag's
          sun, but after struggling for a while and not making much progress, I
          decided to put it on hold for the time being and return to it once I
          have more experience under my belt.<br />
          Overall, I'm a bit disappointed I wasn't able to achieve what I
          originally set out to, but I am also glad I started this project, and
          optimistic that I will finish this drawing in the near future.
